# Graduation Project Management with Network Optimization for Non-Traditional Students
### In partial-fulfillment of DATA 4395 UHD Senior Project

While UHD offers four-year degree maps for Data Science majors, these plans require taking heavy course-loads that are impractical for non-traditional students who must work jobs or have children. In this paper, this problem is addressed by using project management techniques known as CPM (Critical Path Method), PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique), and survey results from 14 current Data Science majors, to build graduation network models to derive optimized graduation paths. Three recommended four-year degree plans, including two summers, were created for students who cannot accommodate more than four courses a semester (on average) but need a minimum of 12 hours to meet financial aid requirements.
